Metricbeat, Filebeat, Packetbeat, Functionbeat and Heartbeat are a few examples of Beats.

Metricbeat is a server monitoring agent that periodically collects metrics from the operating systems and services running on your servers.

Filebeat ships log files from your servers.

Packetbeat is a network packet analyzer that ships information about the transactions exchanged between your application servers. And Heartbeat checks the uptime availability of resources.

Unlike [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/8.13/index.html), which only tells you if your servers are up or down, Heartbeat tells you whether your services are reachable.
